        <h1>America: Rebecoming the Greatness We Never Weren't</h1>
        <p>I  read this book to my microvave and it turned into an oven.</p>
        <p> "The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Just make sure you thrust upwards through his rib cage."</p>
        <p>  "Don't cry over spilled milk. By this time tomorrow, it'll be free yogurt." </p>
        <p> "The pen is mightier than the sword, if you shoot that pen out of a gun."</p>
